    "## API Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The core programming skill of the activity is to learn to query an online Application Programmer Interface (API). It is a similar experience to browsing the Internet, and initial results can be displayed the web browser. When visiting a web page, the address bar typically contains something like\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\texttt{https://} \\underbrace{\\texttt{www.}}_{\\text{World Wide Web subdomain}} \\texttt{domain}. \\underbrace{\\texttt{tld}}_{\\text{Top level domain}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the https:// specifies the protocol, www. specifies the world-wide-web subdomain, the domain is the entity, and the top-level domain .tld is typically something like .com or .gov, but is increasingly varied as ICANN releases more TLD's into circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With an online API, the user instead enters a url that goes directly to an API subdomain\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\texttt{https://} \\underbrace{\\texttt{api.}}_{\\text{Application programmer interface}} \\texttt{domain.tld}/ \\texttt{(the query)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "or accesses REST services as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\texttt{https://www.domain.tld} \\underbrace{\\texttt{/REST}}_{\\text{Accesses REST services}}/ \\texttt{(the query)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This accesses data on the domain's servers and returns the result directly to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query itself is typically a string beginning with a question mark ?, followed by a series of expressions joined by ampersands &. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "`?ProductType=Phone\\&Manufacturer=Apple`\n",
    "\n",
    "passes a query requesting all records for which the product type is recorded as phone and the manufacturer is recorded as Apple. Some API's include date ranges and other, more complex requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, a simple warm-up is to use the API from saferproducts.gov, which has a simple and intuitive structure for queries, and the results are simple enough to look at in the browser. Typing this in the address bar in a browser should yield about thirty records:\n",

    "## Accessing API's with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime you use a computer to access resources on the Internet, you will likely run into problems. There are many options, but two with low coding overhead: The `requests` and `urrlib.requests` packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code chunk uses the `requests` package to get the same kind of data that was being displayed in the browser, but in an interactive Python session:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import requests\n",
    "    url = 'https://www.saferproducts.gov/RestWebServices/' # Location of the API\n",
    "    query = 'Recall?format=json&ProductType=Exercise' # The query\n",
    "    header = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:124.0)\n",
    "        Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0'} # The user-agent to avoid being blocked\n",
    "    raw = requests.get(url+query,headers=header) # Query the database\n",
    "    data = raw.json() # Convert data from json to dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the code easier to read, it separates the url and the query into two different strings, then concatenates them in the GET request. This makes it easier to edit the query, as well as suggests a simple way to loop over a number of queries that might be sent to the same API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many resources are designed to block access from particular kinds of users. In order to circumvent these obstacles, you can specify a `header` dictionary that presents the query to the server as coming from a hypothetical and common user. In this case, the header presents the query as coming from a Firefox browser from a Windows computer, rather than something like `python-requests/3.12.1`. This problem appears generally in scraping data from the web, and can grind the process to a halt. For whatever reason, I have been blocked and gotten 403 errors with the `requests` package, which motivated me to prepare a second alternative that seems more robust:\n",

    "To complete the pipeline from data to product, we can use \\texttt{streamlit} to quickly convert Python code into a web page that can be accessed locally. This can be done with essentially three lines of code: An import statement, a $.title()$ method call to set the page title, and an $.write()$ call to push the results to the page. Although relatively static, completing this step serves a pedogogical and psychological purpose: It pivots the students to thinking about how to communicate results to an audience, and how the project could become an ongoing endeavor rather than a single analytical exercise.\n",

    "\n",
    "    https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?_res_format_limit=0&res_format=API\n",
    "\n",
    "and in the future will likely easily be found at \\texttt{data.gov}. Some highlights include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- CDC WONDER API for Data Query Web Service: Includes death certificates with causes since approximately the 1990's.\n",
    "- Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS): Housing and Urban Development (HUD) maintains an API that provides Census data on housing problems and needs unavailable through other sources, including IPUMS.\n",
    "- Federal Election Commission API: Provides historical and up to the minute campaign finance data.\n",
    "- Toxic Release Inventory: Provided by the Environmental Protection Agency, this API documents the release and management of over 800 toxic substances, reported annually by privately owned facilities and the government.\n",
    "- Petroleum Data, Prices: Provides prices of petroleum products and crude oil at weekly, monthly, and yearly time scales.\n",
    "- Fair Market Rents Lookup tool: Fair Market Rents (FMRs) determine the value of housing vouchers for Section 8 renters. This API provides the FMR values and other measures of housing affordability.\n",
    "- Annual Economic Surveys, Business Patterns: Surveys of businesses at the zip code level, tracking economic sentiment and activity.\n",
    "- Food Access Research Atlas: Provides spatial data on food access and the availability of supermarkets within census tracts. Can be merged with census data to look at under-served populations and food deserts.\n",
    "- National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration: Provides API access to data on real time weather and climate change projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these API resources could either be the cornerstone of a project or a source of additional data. These data sources have a number of advantages: They're free, most of them can be accessed using the same API key, and most have similar documentation for how to write a query. This is ideal for students to iterate, experiment, and take risks, with little cost to failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to government data, many commerical apps provide API access to developers and researchers. AirBnB, Amazon, Reddit, eBay, X, and many others maintain API access to develop third-party apps. These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Pick an API, download some data, wrangle them, and produce some EDA results, as we did in the previous steps with the saferproducts.gov API; or, if you can't get it to work, document why. If you have the time and it's low cost, push the results to a streamlit page. If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
